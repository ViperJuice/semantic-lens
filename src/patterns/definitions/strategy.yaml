description: >
  Context class uses an interface with multiple implementations.
  The context delegates behavior to a strategy implementation at runtime.

roles:
  context:
    kind: class
  strategy_interface:
    kind: interface
  strategy_impl:
    kind: class

    from: context
    to: strategy_interface
  - type: edge
    kind: implements
    from: strategy_impl
    to: strategy_interface
  - type: group
    role: strategy_impl
